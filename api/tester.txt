Starlight Innovations - Internal Memo

Project Overview:
Project Nova is our flagship initiative for Q3 2025, focused on developing a next-generation solar panel technology. The lead engineer for this project is Dr. Aris Thorne. The primary goal is to increase energy conversion efficiency by at least 15% over our current "Sunbeam v2" model. The project's budget is set at $2.5 million.

Project Team & Key Dates:
The core team consists of Dr. Thorne (Lead Engineer), Maria Garcia (Project Manager), and Ben Carter (Materials Scientist). The project kickoff was on June 1st, 2025. The deadline for the first functional prototype is September 30th, 2025. The final report is due to the board on October 15th, 2025.

Technical Details:
Project Nova will utilize perovskite crystals instead of traditional silicon. While more volatile, perovskite offers a theoretical efficiency ceiling that is much higher. Ben Carter's primary responsibility is to stabilize the perovskite compound for long-term use. The project codename for the new material is "PX-80".
